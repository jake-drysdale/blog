Hello and welcome to my research blog. I am a PhD student in the Digital Media Technology Lab (DMT Lab) at Birmingham City University working on neural audio synthesis and automatic music generation. As an electronic musician, I am always on the lookout for new sounds and ways to express myself creatively through music. With a background in machine learning and artificial intelligence, my aim as a researcher is to help towards the development of
data driven music production tools that can push the boundaries imposed by current technology.
