A vapor is different from an aerosol. An aerosol is a suspension of tiny particles of liquid, solid, or both within a gas.</p>\n<p>For example, water has a critical temperature of 647 K (374 °C; 705 °F), which is the highest temperature at which liquid water can exist. In the atmosphere at ordinary temperatures, therefore, gaseous water (known as water vapor) will condense into a liquid if its partial pressure is increased sufficiently.</p>\n<p>A vapor may co-exist with a liquid (or a solid). When this is true, the two phases will be in equilibrium, and the gas-partial pressure will be equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure of the liquid (or solid).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Vapor","date":"March 09, 2020","tags":["vapor","wikipedia"],"description":null,"thumbnail":null}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/vapor/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","tags":["new","begin"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/aesthetics/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Aesthetics","tags":["aesthetic","art","wikipedia"]}}}}}
